/* Ping Sensor & ActivityBot program to demonstrate a simple proportional feedback control system to
 * allow the ActivityBot to navigate by using echo location to sense the distance to an adjacent wall
 * and to maintain a constant distance between the Ping sensor and the wall while traveling.
 * 
 * The program measures the forward distance to the next obstacle, assuming it is the wall and tracks
 * forward travel by using wheel encoder ticks.  The final stopping position is controlled by using
 * the Ping sensor.
 * 
 * This version of the program is incomplete, and does not fully implement: 
 * Ping reading outlier control
 * Missing wall section detection or mitigation
 * detection of obstacles other than walls
 * use of a full PID control algorithm.
 * 
 * Test the PING))) sensor before using it to navigate with the ActivityBot.
 * 9 waypoints with 256 inches (6.5 meters) of travel at 75 ticks/s (244mm/s) takes ~45 seconds

  Code written in the C language for the Parallax Activity Board WX

  Setup the Laser Range Finder (LRF) Module. The response rate is about 4 Hz (supposed to be 5 Hz).
  
  When the LRF powers on, it launches an auto-baud routine to determine the host's baud rate. 
  It will stay in this state until a "U" ($55) character is sent by the host. 
  On a cold start, the program must transmit a 'U' character to let the LRF identify the baud rate.
  
  Output:
  If the baud rate of the LRF has not been set (on cold start), then the response to the 
  'U' command will be 2 characters ^M:
  if the baud rate has been set (warm program reload), then the response to the 'U'
  command will be 3 characers ?^M:
  
  The 'B' command causes the LRF to take a single measurement and reply with a 2-byte integer
  value in mm units followed by 2 characters (the last on is a :).
